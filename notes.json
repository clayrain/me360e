Gray will receive the Gordon E. Sawyer Award (an Oscar\u00ae statuette), presented \u201cto an individual in the motion picture industry whose technological contributions have brought credit to the industry.\u201d Gray\u2019s career has encompassed the design, refinement and implementation of groundbreaking cinema sound technologies, including stereo optical soundtracks, digital sound on film and most recently, Dolby Atmos\u00ae. He has served for many years on the Academy\u2019s Science and Technology Council and its Theater Standards Committee, among others, as well as chaired the audio study group of SMPTE\u2019s pioneering DC28 technology committee, from which the first two SMPTE Digital Cinema standards were published.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur honorees represent an enormous range of technologies, from camera rigs to software systems, with names as colorful as \u2018Biscuit Jr.,\u2019 \u2018Barbershop\u2019 and \u2018PhysBAM,\u2019\u201d said Richard Edlund, Academy Award\u00ae-winning visual effects artist and chair of the Scientific and Technical Awards Committee. \u201cThey exemplify the phenomenal creativity of professionals in the scientific and technical community, and the invaluable contributions they make to what is arguably the most creative industry in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\nUnlike other Academy Awards to be presented this year, achievements receiving Scientific and Technical Awards need not have been developed and introduced during 2014. Rather, the achievements must demonstrate a proven record of contributing significant value to the process of making motion pictures.","date":"","contact":"","link":"links"}}},null,{"photos":{"images":[]},"text":{"text":{"title":"B","blurb":"B","date":"Jan 2","contact":"","link":""}}},{"photos":{"images":[]},"text":{"text":{"title":"","blurb":"","date":"","contact":"","link":""}}}]
